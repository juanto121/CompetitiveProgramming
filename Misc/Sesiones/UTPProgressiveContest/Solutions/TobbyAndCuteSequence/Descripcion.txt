Description

Tobby really loves the sequences, but he loves the "cute sequence" more. A "cute sequence" is a special sequence that holds the follow:
The size of the sequence is exactly n
Each number in the sequence is unique
Each number in the sequence is 0 < a_i < 10^9
Each a_i for 1 < i < n, must satisfy  | a_i-1 - a_i | > | a_i - a_i+1 |
Tobby is not a complicated dog, so he wants any cute sequence. Given n, find out any "cute sequence".
Input specification

Every test case contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 1000). You must read until you reach the EOF.

Output specification

For each test case, your program must produce a single line of output, with a cute sequence of size n. Any sequence will do as long as it's a valid cute sequence as described above.
